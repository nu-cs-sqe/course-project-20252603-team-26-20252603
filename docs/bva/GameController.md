# BVA Analysis for `GameController`
Class definition:

` 
class GameController {
private Game game;
    public void startGame(List<String> playerNames);
} 
`

## Method under test: `startGame(List<String> playerNames)`
**Step 1: identify the input/outup equivilence classes**
- input: group/collection/list of player names
- output: None --> start the game

**Step 2:Choose relevant data type from BVA Catolog**
  - input: 
    - colelctions
    - strings
  - output: 
    - none 
    - check the state of the game: has it started or not --> Boolean
**Step 3: Use the BVA catalog to select concrete values**
  - input
    - empty / no player: []
    - only one player: ['one player']
    - more than one element: ['player one','player 2', 'player 3']
    - maz possible size / max number of players (5): ['player one','player 2', 'player 3', 'player4', player5']
    - contains duplicate elements:
      - only applicable if we start by entering player names (we do)
      - ["alex", "alex"]
        - sounds like a valid case, I would suggest a flow where the second user is prompted to add a number / nickname to differentiate
    - **Sequenceable Collection**
      - not important unless this method has control over the order players take turns
    - **Strings:**
      - the empty string ['']
      - do we need to check if it's not a string
  - output
    - 0 / False / Game Not Started
    - 1 / True / Game Started
    - there are no circumastances where neither is true
**Step 4:**
